# Summary
The global market value of AI, estimated at 1
5.7 trillion in 2030, is expected to contribute significantly to the global economy by then. This growth is projected to be 97 million people working in AI by 2024 and a 13x increase over the next eight years.
AI's impact extends beyond search engines; it's anticipated that 2 percent of the world's benefits from AI by the end of this decade, equivalent to 320 billion, with the Middle East expected to partake in this growth.
While tools like ChatGPT can be useful for simplifying tasks and providing engaging content, experts stress the importance of fact-checking due to its potential for misinformation. AI models, such as large-language models (LLMs), are not capable of understanding context or reasoning in a conventional sense; they simply match patterns based on training data.
Despite these capabilities, human intelligence and awareness remain essential for the safe expansion of AI use. The UAE Minister of Education acknowledged the potential of ChatGPT to assist in content creation but reassured that it cannot replace creativity or human insight found in human writers.
The debate surrounding AI's impact remains divided, with optimists believing it will augment human capabilities and pessimists fearing widespread automation could lead to job displacement. Regardless of the perspectives, trust is crucial for the ethical integration of AI solutions into society.
In conclusion, while AI holds immense investment potential with forecasts valuing in trillions of dollars, it's essential to address concerns about misinformation and maintain human involvement to ensure a safe and beneficial use of AI technologies worldwide.
