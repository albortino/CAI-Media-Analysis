# Hypothesis/Questions
## Question 1
*How do the media in this article frame the public discussion about ChatGPT? Are there certain 'metaphors' that keep cropping up?*
The media frames the public discussion about ChatGPT using a variety of metaphors, including comparisons to historic technological milestones ('Netscape moment'), patterns in language models, and AI's infancy. It also highlights AI's potential benefits and risks, emphasizing its limitations when compared to human intelligence. The media acknowledges ChatGPT as a valuable tool with transformative power, but warns about the ethical challenges it presents. This consistent use of metaphors underscores both the exciting advancements and concerns surrounding AI technology like ChatGPT.
Reasoning: The media frames the public discussion about ChatGPT using a variety of metaphors, reflecting both the positive and negative aspects of this AI technology. These metaphors include: 

1. 'Unlike anything we have ever seen': This emphasizes ChatGPT's rapid progression and groundbreaking nature in the AI landscape.
2. 'Netscape moment' or 'Large Language Model LLM': Metaphors that depict ChatGPT as a transformative tool, similar to Netscape's impact on the World Wide Web, or comparing it to autocomplete on steroids.
3. 'Infancy of ChatGPT': Highlighting its current developmental stage and potential for improvement.
4. 'Superficial and dubious nature' and 'highly plausible misinformation': Metaphors pointing out the limitations and potential risks of AI in generating convincing, yet false, information.
